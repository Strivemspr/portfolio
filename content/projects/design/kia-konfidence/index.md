# Kia Konfidence - Heartland Bank Partner

* * *

## Introduction

During my time working at Heartland Bank I had the opportunity to work on the design for the Kia Finance Partner website. Where I worked alongside other designers to create the product from scratch which was successfully taken to a fully usable product for the market.

Our objective with this project was to primarily design the partner website to promote the various products and services that are offered, the project was done in an agile manner from ideation, design, testing, development to the final deployment.

## What is Kia Finance?

Kia Finance, provided by Heartland Bank, offers a range of finance and leasing options to help get you or your business moving.

Our products include:

- Vehicle loans with terms from one to five years, tailored to meet your needs

- Kia Konfidence, which guarantees the minimum future value of your Kia before you drive off and at the end of the finance period you can choose whether to retain, replace or return your Kia

- Leasing options to get your business fleet on the road.

Whether youâ€™re buying a new or used Kia, your local Kia dealer will help you find the right finance product for your needs.
