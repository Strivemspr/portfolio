# Creating SnapTalk

* * *

## Personal Project

This is SnapTalk one of my personal projects. I enjoy spending my time learning various things about design and code and this is one of the projects that I created specifically for my portfolio in order to showcase my design as well as my ``html``, ``css``, and ``javascript`` skills.

To be honest this was a quick project, I divided the project into two common phases, design and development. During these phases I went over the following steps.

### Design

- Defining the task
- Research similar ideas
- Brainstorm Ideas
- Creating simple wireframes with pen a paper
- Choose colors and typography
- Start design
- Iterate over design and improve

### Development

- Set up development environment with webpack
- Start Coding
- Improve responsiveness with media queries
- Test and improve
- Deploy to github pages
