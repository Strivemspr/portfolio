## Introduction

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the forkify API to fetch and display food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and add ingredients to a shopping list or save to a favourites list via local storage.

This project was from Jonas Schmedtmann's 'The Complete JavaScript Course' on Udemy. My usual approach to watching video tutorials is to code my solution and then watch the video with the explanation for a specific topic.

### Some of the things learned are:

- Classes and prototype
- Promises
- Async & Await
- Fetching Data from a REST API
- DOM manipulation
- Destructuring
- Error Handling
- Architecture
- Design Patterns
