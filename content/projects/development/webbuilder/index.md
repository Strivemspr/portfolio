# Managing The Atrium Business Websites with Web Builder 

* * *

## Introduction

Web Builder is a school project created for our client, the atrium on elliot, this web application allows you to manage and generate the content for the many businesses owned by the atrium. Additionally each business website is created depending on the theme and attributes selected through the back end dashboard. 

## Process

### Overview

> As mentioned before this is a project for school, where my group worked together with the client to deliver a project that satisfies the business and functional requirements. We worked in an agile methodology with 7 sprints of 2 weeks each. My group consisted of 2 developers and 1 tester. I can say that **teamwork** was the main quality for the successful completion of the project.

### Challenges

Our client had 3 main problems that me and my team solve through the creations of these platform, these are:

- Difficult management of the many businesses websites
- Struggle to update information on the website
- Disorganized and spread information 

### Sprints

1. **Sprint 1**: During the first 2 weeks we organized our roles and carefully researched and studied our clients objectives, business and functional requirements. During this week we also started learning the stack that was proposed by the team and client, we also started setting up the starter files for the project using the Laravel framework and MySQL as the database.

2. **Sprint 2**: Next couple of weeks we designed the main functionality of the content management system with low-fi wireframes and iterated over them with our client in order to get the right features ready for development.

3. **Sprint 3** to **Sprint 5**: As the project objectives, business and functional requirements were clear we started coding the application while still learning the stack, we did hit a few road blocks, but we did manage to deliver the set functionality for the project.

4. **Sprint 6**: During these weeks we started testing the app as well as fixing bugs and implementing some extra features required by the client. 

5. **Sprint 7**: In The last sprint we got the app ready, fully completed the testing and bug fixing and finally we documented the whole app ready for hand off and deployment.

During Each Sprint we scheduled meetings with the client and team members and created reports for each week of work that were later sent to the client and teachers for review.

## If we had more time:

For this school project we focused on delivering the main requirements and features, although there are other things we would have liked to implement if we had more time, these are:

- Better User Interface
- More Dashboard Features
- Email Notifications
- Improve Security
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Conclusion

The project offered many interesting challenges along the way from learning new programming languages to being stuck in project problems or bugs, this project was an introduction to a real life work environment

The CMS that was developed for this project offered a great opportunity to implement a popular PHP framework where many of the concepts can carry over to other programming languages. The CMS was implemented with Laravel at the beginning. We had some trouble setting up some configuration in the project but after more deep learning it was possible to grab the majority of the concepts that this framework has to offer.

Working with a team taught me that It is important to identify the strengths and weaknesses for each member so we can allocate the proper amount of work to each member. Being patient and helpful towards other teammates can make the process a much more productive experience. Overall these projects taught me a lot of things and it was a great experience during my studies.
