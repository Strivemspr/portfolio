# Business Website with Laravel

## Introduction

LR.Bakes is a ``freelance project`` for a small company, this project is currently under development. LR.bakes uses a modern PHP framework called Laravel where I had the opportunity to take my own design to implementation. I will show you my journey with this project.

## Process

> My goal with this project was to offer a nice way for customers to contact the business owners, as well as offering tools that increase the business productivity and reach, this was done through a newsletter and contact form.

I started with the creation of each of the page screens with figma, I designed a couple of mockups which were later translated into scss. The mockups can be found here: [LR.Bakes Design](https://www.figma.com/file/Z3ZPfzVWHsLi7lkZTe09qN/Baking-Website?node-id=0%3A1)

This project was implemented in Laravel because of its rapid development. This allowed me to take the project from design to code in less than a week. Although there are still a lot of things to implement, it has been quite fast for the amount of time I have dedicated to the development.

### Some of the things learned here:

- Laravel framework
- Instragram Basic Display API
- Authentication
- MVC Architecture
- Promises, Async/Await, SASS
- Validation
- Local Storage, Sessions
- Lightbox2

### Coming Features & More
